# Introduction

This script merges an MP4 video file with an MP3 audio file, making the audio the background for the video. The output is saved as a new video file.

## Features

- Adds a 5-second fade-out effect at the end of the audio.
- The duration of the output file is determined by the shorter of the two input files.

## How to Use

1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Open `index.js` and replace the variable values to point to your video and audio files. Also, set the output file name and path.
3. Run `node index.js` and follow the progress.

Once finished, the output file will be saved to the specified location.
